## ðŸ“œ Rules and community standards for referral programme

1. Each application, once submitted for review via a unique referral link, counts as a successful referral, even if it doesn't get accepted.
2. Anyone can apply to a hackathonâ€”even with an existing Devfolio accountâ€”and it will be counted as a referral.
3. Only submitted applications will be counted toward referrals.

## ðŸ“Œ More details

- To incentivize referrals, you can link a Notion doc with the rewards offered to top leaderboard positions.  
- Here's an example from ETHIndia 2022:  
  [ETHIndia 22 Referral Campaign](https://devfolio.notion.site/ETHIndia-22-Referral-Campaign-fe0578518f0040ab8bfba934f135d2b8)
- Once an applicant completes their application, their unique referral link appears on their dashboard. Alternatively, they can visit the leaderboard (e.g., [https://concordia.devfolio.co/leaderboard](https://concordia.devfolio.co/leaderboard)) to find it.

<Callout type="info" title="Referral Links Info">
  These are not referral codes, but unique referral links generated for each applicant. If a hacker signs up using a specific referral link, the referral count is added to that user.
