## Add Users to the Organizer Dashboard

The `Devfolio Username` of the organizer will be required to add them to the team.

As demonstrated above, the modular permission allows you to provide access tab-wise â€” i.e., which tabs of the organizer dashboard they should be able to access.

## Editing & Revoke Access

- The `Edit Access` option allows you to edit the permissions you've provided earlier.  
- The `Remove from Squad` option removes the team member from the dashboard, making it inaccessible to them.
