      In <code>Online</code> mode, you can see a list of hackers with their respective status. You can filter out the list by Country or City depending on the nature of your request.
    </p>

    <p>The <strong>status of the applicant</strong> can be:</p>
    <ul>

  <Tab value="Offline and Online with Application Review Mode">

      Here, you can review individual and team profiles to extend invitations to them to attend your hackathon (accept), decline their application (reject), or waitlist (apply/reject later) them. You can apply various filters to help you in the process.

## Steps to Accept a Participant

  - You want the hacker to participate in the hackathon
  - You want to <strong>temporarily</strong> shortlist the particular hacker

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
  The hacker won't receive any email or notification and you can still change your mind.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Irreversible Action" type="warning">
  Upon doing so, the hacker will be sent an acceptance email and the process is irreversible.
</Callout>

3. On receiving the acceptance email, the hacker will be asked to RSVP to the invitation.


## Steps to Reject a Participant

1. Click on <code>Reject</code> when:
  - You are not overall happy with the profile and don't wish to include the hacker in the hackathon
