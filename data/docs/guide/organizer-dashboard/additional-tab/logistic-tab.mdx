- You can find the T-Shirt size distribution for `Submitted` and `RSVP'd` hackers, which is useful while ordering swag. This can be further categorized gender-wise.  
- Have a quick glance through the list of attendees who have any allergies, according to which you can arrange the necessary requirements.
