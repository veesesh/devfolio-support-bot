description: Check-ins on Devfolio are a breeze!
---

Devfolio provides an easy way to keep track of the attendees present at the hackathon through the <strong>Volunteer</strong> tab in the organizer dashboard.

The <code>expected</code> count at the bottom indicates the number of hackers who have confirmed their intention to attend the hackathon by completing the RSVP process.

<p align="center"><i>Check-in a hacker by username</i></p>

- Email ID  
- Team name in the format: <code>team: team-name</code>

## ðŸ“Œ Points to Note

- Check-ins are **individual-level** and must be done for every team member.
- Hackers must be checked-in to be allowed to submit their project on Devfolio.
- Hackers who donâ€™t check-in cannot claim participation or submit projects.
- Itâ€™s good practice to assign Volunteer Tab access to multiple volunteers via the Team Tab and start check-ins early.
- Only hackers who have RSVP'd can be checked in.
