### The dashboard is conveniently divided into three segments:

1. **Active Hackathons:** This segment lists all the hackathons you are currently organizing or co-organizing. Keep track of ongoing hackathons and manage them in real-time.  
2. **Past Hackathons:** A record of all the hackathons you've successfully organized in the past. Reflect on completed events, gather insights, and improve for the future.  
3. **Drafts:** All the hackathons that are still in the planning phase. This is your workspace to organize and manage all the details before they go live.
