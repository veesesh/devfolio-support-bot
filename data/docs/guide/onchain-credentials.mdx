## 🤔 **What are Onchain Credentials?**

Builders’ digital proof-of-work that is always on display, independently verifiable, and their gateway to new opportunities.

## 😬 **Here’s why we decided to bring them in:**

### The problem:

We realised that there are some problems with the current way of rewarding or credentialing builders at hackathons — like the lack of verifiability, inconsistent standards, and difficulties in displaying achievements.

### The solution:

With Onchain Credentials, we can overcome these problems by ensuring a reliable verification process, establishing standardized evaluation criteria, facilitating easy sharing on different platforms, and promoting inclusivity.

Besides, Onchain Credentials being stored securely on the blockchain help builders build their digital identity and proof-of-work. In the future, we see them acting as a pass to more events and opportunities.

Smart contracts can automate the issuance process for these Credentials, leading to better recognition of participants' achievements and creating more opportunities for them.

## 💪 **What this means for builders:**

1. _Make your skills more credible_ through solid proof for everything you’ve built on Devfolio.
2. _Exhibit your story and work_ publicly with verifiable details.
3. Proudly display and cherish a _tangible souvenir_.

- Onchain Credentials also rely on [EAS](https://attest.sh/) for attestations, just like [Cheer](crypto-cheer.md) and [Quadratic Voting](quadratic-voting-on-devfolio.md) on Devfolio.
- Find the EAS Schema for Onchain Credentials here:  
  [arbitrum.easscan.org/schema/view/...](http://arbitrum.easscan.org/schema/view/0x364a59df1d48d4b6c0f8f0c1176504b252bce5ce57e0d1ca75b1bf70c2f0ec14)
- The execution of the transaction and payment of the gas fee is done either by the user or by Devfolio.

> ℹ️ **Pro tip**: With our **‘Claim’** feature, organizers can award builders with exclusive Onchain Credentials for their hackathon — and builders can claim them directly from their [dashboard](onchain-credentials.md)!
