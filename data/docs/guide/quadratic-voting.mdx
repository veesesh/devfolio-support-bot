## 🤔 What is Quadratic Voting?

A mathematically optimal way of voting which goes beyond a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ vote, enabling people to choose the intensity of their preferences. And we decided to implement it at hackathons. Why? Because hackathons result in a wide range of projects, and it can be challenging to determine which projects are the most liked by people. QV enables people to vote for a project depending on how much they like it.

## ✨ For Builders — How to Make the Most of Quadratic Voting

Your project page will be the **single source of information** for all the voters, which makes it crucial that it has all the relevant information they would need to decide if they want to vote for your project.

To ensure this, keep the following points in mind:

- Add all the important information about your project, along with the detailed context in the forms of description, images, videos, GitHub links, etc. to your project page.
- After submitting the project, make sure to keep it updated so that no bit of your hardwork goes unseen.
- Make sure that your Devfolio profile is up to date at all points in time. This helps the voters to learn more deeply and personally about you and your overarching motivations.
