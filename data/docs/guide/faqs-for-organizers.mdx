### 📝 When can we access the Devfolio portal for registrations?

The Organizer Dashboard is visible as soon as your hackathon is verified by Devfolio.  
If you have submitted your hackathon for review, reach out to us at `community@devfolio.co` to learn the next steps.


### ⏰ Some participants missed their RSVP deadline and their status shows "Withdrawn". What should I do?

You can extend the RSVP deadline in the **Admin Tab**, and send out an announcement to the accepted hackers to RSVP if they haven't yet.

You can also choose to RSVP them yourself from the Admin Tab. Start searching for the team or the hacker to reveal the **Status** section, and click on the toggle to RSVP them.

### 👥 I cannot add teammates in my organizer dashboard

Only the **creator** of the hackathon has permission to add teammates. Other members, even with all permissions, cannot add or remove teammates.


### 📝 Can I change the fields present in the Application Form?

If you haven't submitted your hackathon for review, you can make changes by updating your hackathon.


### 📂 Where can I view the submissions made to my hackathon?

You can find the submissions on your hackathon's **microsite**.


### 🧠 How do I add Problem Statements to the hackathon?

You can add it as a **track** to your hackathon via the `Prizes Tab`. This will enable hackers to select the track if their hack is built around the problem statement.

### 👤 I had specified the minimum number of team members. Why do I still see solo applicants?

Hackers can submit applications individually, and you can accept them as well.  
However, before making a **project submission**, they must join/create a team that meets the minimum team size requirement.
