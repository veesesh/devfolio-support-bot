## Getting Started with Devfolio: A Complete Guide

This guide outlines the key activities and processes for hackers using the Devfolio platform. While Devfolio offers access to hackathons and events all year round, your experience as a hacker will be broadly divided into three main phases:

- Pre-hackathon preparation
- Hackathon participation
- Post-hackathon activities

This meta-doc will help you navigate the various activities relevant to you as a hacker. Each of these points has an associated page, where the specific part of the process has been elaborated for you to follow along if you feel stuck.

## ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Pre-Hackathon Phase

The pre-hackathon phase focuses on platform familiarization and account setup. Complete these essential steps before participating in hackathons:

Your profile serves as your digital portfolio on Devfolio. Include relevant technical skills, achievements, and hackathon experiences. A comprehensive profile increases your chances of hackathon acceptance.
