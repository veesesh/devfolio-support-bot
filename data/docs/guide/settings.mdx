</Callout> */}

You can find the `Account Settings` option in the drop-down after clicking on your profile in the top-right corner. This gives you access to a wide array of options that you can use to manage your account's visibility and security.

## Account Section

In the Account section, you can perform a wide array of actions. They are as follows:

### Change/Add/Remove Your Avatar

Avatar refers to the image that is shown alongside your profile name whenever your Devfolio profile is referenced. You can delete your avatar by clicking on 'Delete avatar', or change it by clicking on 'Upload new', choosing an image file from your system, and confirming your selection. This will lead you to a resizing tool on the platform, where you can resize the chosen image to your liking. Once done, you can click on Continue to update your avatar on Devfolio.

<Callout type="info">
  The image can only be resized to a square i.e. the ratio of length to the breadth of the image has to be 1:1.
</Callout>

### Change Your Username

Your username is the primary identifier by which you are known on Devfolio. You can change this by clicking on 'Update username' and modifying your username as you see fit. Please note, that a successful username change is subject to the availability of the username i.e. if any other account has claimed the username you desire, you will not be able to claim the same username.

Once done, click on 'Save' to change your username. If there's no conflict with any other user, your username will be updated automatically.

<Callout type="info">
  Please note that you can change your username only once every 90 days.
</Callout>

### Change Your email address

You can change your email address by clicking on 'Change email'. This will prompt you to enter your current email address, followed by the new email address you wish to use. Once done, click on 'Save' to update your email address.

### Link Your Social Media Accounts

You can link your social media accounts to your Devfolio profile by clicking on the 'Link' button next to each social media platform. This will allow you to showcase your work and connect with other builders on the platform. The available platforms include:
* LinkedIn
* Google
* GitHub
* Discord

### Making Your Devfolio Profile Private

Your Devfolio profile is a means for you to showcase your work to every builder who's using the platform. However, if you wish to keep your profile private, you can choose to do so by clicking on the checkbox 'Hide my Devfolio profile from public view' and confirming your choice. This will result in the following:

* Your profile will not be shown in Devfolio search results.
* Any attempts to access your Devfolio profile through your QR code will result in a 'Hidden Profile' view.
* Any attempts to access your Devfolio profile through your unique profile URL (devfolio.co/@yourusername) will result in a 'Hidden Profile' view.
