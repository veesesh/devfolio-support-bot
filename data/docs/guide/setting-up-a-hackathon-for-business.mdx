title: Setting Up a Hackathon for Business
---

As a business, organizing hackathons can be an effective way to put the word out about your product in the developer community, collect feedback and grow your team.

On hosting a hackathon on Devfolio, businesses get **priority support**, help with **profile review** and **outreach**. You donâ€™t need to have a hackathon website to start accepting applications with Devfolio. With a **dedicated Devfolio hosted subdomain,** you can get up and running within no time.

Reach out to us on **partner@devfolio.co** for pricing information.

> **Note:** Please reach out to us regarding the activation of your hackathon in case you have already set it up on the organizer dashboard ([org.devfolio.co](http://org.devfolio.co/)).

## **Step 1**

* Navigate to our organizer Dashboard at [https://org.devfolio.co](https://org.devfolio.co/)

* Once we've validated the details and confirmed the legitimacy, your hackathon will be verified.
