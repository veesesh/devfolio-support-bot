## 🚀 Make your profile stand out

To make your profile shine, fill out the following sections:

### 🧾 About Section

Kick-start here by updating your profile with basic information, such as your name, identified gender, food preferences, and t-shirt size. 

This helps hackathon organizers gather your dietary preferences and schwag sizes with ease!

If you're someone who doesn't have a formal education, don't worry! We strive to be inclusive for all builders, irrespective of their educational background. You can simply click on the appropriate checkbox to proceed to the next section
