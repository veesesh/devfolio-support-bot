description: Adding Prizes is the best way of introducing Track Prizes in your Hackathon so that if a hacker has built a project for a specific track, they can submit it to the particular track.

  Have tracks? Add them first. Otherwise, add the prizes directly. You can edit and add prizes or tracks even after your hackathon goes live and add winners once your hackathon ends.

## What is a Track?

A track is a field the builder chooses while submitting their project. This helps organizers _categorize_ projects.

- Visible in the [project submission](../../guide/participating-in-hackathons/project-submission.mdx) view for hackers  
- Organizers create the tracks, and hackers opt-in to be a part of the track in the submission flow

## How to Add a Track  

Adding tracks is a great way to guide participants toward specific themes, technologies, or problem statements in your hackathon. Tracks allow organizers to define focus areas, while hackers can choose the track that best fits their submission. Here’s how you can set up tracks:  

### Step-by-Step Process  

1. **Go to the Prizes Tab**  
   - Log in to the Organizer Dashboard.  
   - From the left-hand menu, select the **Prizes** tab. This is where you can manage both prizes and tracks for your hackathon.  

2. **Click on the “Add Track” Button**  
   - At the top-right corner, you’ll find the **Add Track** button.  
   - Clicking this will open a form to create a new track.  

3. **Enter Track Details**  
   - Provide a clear and concise **Track Name** (e.g., *AI for Social Good*, *Sustainability & Climate Tech*, *Blockchain Innovation*).  
   - Add a detailed **Description** explaining what the track is about, the kind of projects encouraged, and any specific guidelines you want hackers to know.  

4. **Save the Track**  
   - Once you’ve filled in the details, click **Add Track** again to save.  
   - Your newly created track will now appear under the Prizes tab.  

### Important Notes  

- **Organizer Role:** Only organizers can create tracks. Participants cannot add or edit them.  
- **Hacker Opt-In:** During the submission process, hackers will be able to select which track(s) they want their project to be considered for.  
- **Multiple Tracks:** You are not limited to just one track — feel free to add as many as you need to cover all themes or focus areas of your event.  

By setting up tracks thoughtfully, you help participants align their ideas with the vision of the hackathon, while also making it easier for judges to review submissions under different categories.  



## What is a Prize?

A prize is a _sub-category_ field that has a dollar value attached to it.

- Visible in the prizes tab on the microsite  
- Organizers create the prizes, and **only organizers can add winners to the projects** through the Hackathon Update Dashboard.

### Once you add track and prizes, you will see the changes reflected on the microsite under `Prizes tab`

## Pointers to remember:

- Organizers can add winners to the respective prizes once the hackathon ends.  
- Hackers can choose the sponsor prize they are submitting while adding a project  
- Once the organizer updates Sponsors from the [sponsor tab](../../guide/setting-up-your-hackathon/partner-tab.mdx), a separate track opens up for them (right side) in the prizes tab
