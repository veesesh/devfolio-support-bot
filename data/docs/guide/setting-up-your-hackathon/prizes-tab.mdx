title: Prizes Tab
description: Adding Prizes is the best way of introducing Track Prizes in your Hackathon so that if a hacker has built a project for a specific track, they can submit it to the particular track.

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
  Have tracks? Add them first. Otherwise, add the prizes directly. You can edit and add prizes or tracks even after your hackathon goes live and add winners once your hackathon ends.

## What is a Track?

A track is a field the builder chooses while submitting their project. This helps organizers _categorize_ projects.

- Visible in the [project submission](../../guide/participating-in-hackathons/project-submission.mdx) view for hackers  
- Organizers create the tracks, and hackers opt-in to be a part of the track in the submission flow

## What is a Prize?

A prize is a _sub-category_ field that has a dollar value attached to it.

- Visible in the prizes tab on the microsite  
- Organizers create the prizes, and **only organizers can add winners to the projects** through the Hackathon Update Dashboard.

### Once you add track and prizes, you will see the changes reflected on the microsite under `Prizes tab`

## Pointers to remember:

- Organizers can add winners to the respective prizes once the hackathon ends.  
- Hackers can choose the sponsor prize they are submitting while adding a project  
- Once the organizer updates Sponsors from the [sponsor tab](../../guide/setting-up-your-hackathon/partner-tab.mdx), a separate track opens up for them (right side) in the prizes tab
