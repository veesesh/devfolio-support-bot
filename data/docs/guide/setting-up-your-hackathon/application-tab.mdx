## Using Built-in Fields for your Application

To help you save time, Devfolio provides you with built-in fields that are commonly used. You can decide what fields hackers need to fill in while applying for your hackathon.

<Callout title="Mandatory Fields" type="error">
  The fields selected here are marked as mandatory! If you want to make them optional, you can proceed to add them as a custom question.
</Callout>

Here's how it will look when the hacker fills out the application for your hackathon.

<Callout title="Auto-filled Fields" type="info">
  At times, hackers may have already added some fields such as GitHub or LinkedIn links to their profile. So when they start filling out the application, the available details are directly taken from their profile and are not asked again. The ones not available are then explicitly asked for.
</Callout>

## Adding Custom Questions

<Callout title="Pro Tip" type="info">
  You need not add custom questions for social media links if they're mandatory for your application since we have provided them in our pre-built fields.
</Callout>

If you wish to create custom questions, click on the `+ Add` button at the bottom. There are a variety of **Field Types** available to cater to most of your questions.
