## Why FAQs Matter

- **Reduce repetitive queries** ‚Üí Hackers often ask the same questions (e.g., travel reimbursements, eligibility, prize details). FAQs cut down repetitive communication.  
- **Boost transparency** ‚Üí Clear FAQs create trust by providing upfront information.  
- **Save time** ‚Üí Organizers don‚Äôt need to repeatedly reply to the same questions via email or Discord.  
- **Improve hacker experience** ‚Üí Hackers feel more confident about participating when their doubts are already addressed.
