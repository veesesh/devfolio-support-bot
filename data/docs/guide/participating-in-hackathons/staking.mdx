## 🤔 What is Staking?

Staking is a commitment mechanism used by hackathon organizers to ensure serious participation from registered hackers.

It involves placing a **refundable deposit** (in INR or ETH) to guarantee your attendance and project submission. This helps organizers plan resources effectively and reduce no-shows.



## 🧾 Why Do Hackathons Implement Staking?

Hackathons invest a lot into:

- Venue and logistics
- Food and refreshments
- Mentorship and swag
- Sometimes even travel reimbursements

Staking helps reduce participant dropouts and ensures that these resources are well-utilized.



## 💳 Available Staking Methods

### 🏦 Fiat Currency Staking (INR)

- Commonly used for Indian participants
- Paid via Razorpay or similar gateways
- Typically INR 1000
- Fully refundable on valid participation

### 🪙 Cryptocurrency Staking (ETH)

- Requires a one-time transfer to Devfolio's managed wallet
- ETH amount is equivalent to the INR amount (converted at current exchange rates)
- Refund sent back to your original crypto wallet



## 🔁 Refund Policy

To get your refund:

1. Submit a project during the hackathon  
**or**  
2. Provide valid proof of absence to the organizers

Refunds will be sent via:

- Razorpay/bank (for INR payments)
- Wallet (for ETH staking)
