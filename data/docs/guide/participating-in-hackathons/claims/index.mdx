The **Claims** page is your central hub for collecting all rewards and recognition earned through your participation in Devfolio hackathons and events. It brings together three core types of claims: **schwag**, **bounties**, and **onchain credentials**.

<p><img src="/assets/image (6).webp" alt="Claims Page UI" /></p>

Each reward type is neatly categorized and serves a different purpose:


### 🧢 Schwag

These are physical goodies like Devfolio-branded t-shirts, stickers, or other merch earned via participation or achievement at hackathons.

🧾 To learn how to claim your schwag:

### 💰 Bounties

Monetary rewards given by sponsors for solving specific challenges or building with their technologies. Claiming bounties may require additional verification like project reviews or documentation.

<Callout type="warning" title="Understanding Claim Availability">
If you don’t see anything to claim, it might be because:
1. You haven’t earned anything in that category yet  
2. The claiming window hasn’t been opened by the organizers

If you're unsure, please reach out to the hackathon organizers for clarification.

### ✅ Important Considerations

1. **⏰ Time Sensitivity**: Some claims (like bounties) may expire. Act promptly!
2. **📄 Verification**: Make sure you’ve submitted any required docs or links.
3. **📦 Shipping Info**: Keep your shipping address up to date to avoid delivery issues.
4. **💸 Wallet Access**: For onchain claims, ensure your wallet is connected — you may need to cover minor gas fees.
