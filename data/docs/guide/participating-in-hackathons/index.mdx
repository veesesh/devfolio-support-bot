Participating in a hackathon involves several interconnected stages, each building upon the previous one to create a complete experience. This guide will walk you through the entire process, helping you understand what to expect and how to make the most of your participation.

## Types of Hackathons

Hackathons come in several formats, each offering unique advantages:

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **In-person hackathons** provide direct collaboration and networking opportunities.
- 🌐 **Virtual hackathons** offer flexibility and global participation.
  - Some virtual events include an application review process, while others maintain an open registration model.
- 🔄 **Hybrid hackathons** combine both approaches.

## 📝 The Application Phase

When you decide to join a hackathon, you'll begin with the application process. This typically involves sharing your background, skills, and motivation for participating.

Think of this as introducing yourself to the organizers and helping them understand how you might contribute to the event's success.
