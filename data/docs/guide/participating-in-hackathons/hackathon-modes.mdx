description: Understand the three different hackathon modes supported on Devfolio.

> **TL;DR:** Devfolio hackathons are hosted in one of the following three modes:

- **Offline Hackathon:** On-site only. Your application is reviewed. If accepted, you must be physically present at the venue.
- **Online With Application Review:** Application is reviewed. Once accepted, you RSVP, check in, and then submit a project as a team.
- **Online Hackathon:** No review required. Submit during the submission period directly, solo or in a team.
