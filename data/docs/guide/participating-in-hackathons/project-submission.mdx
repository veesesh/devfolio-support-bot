### Step 1: Head to Your Hackathon Dashboard

- Log in to your Devfolio account.
- Go to the Hackathon you're participating in.
- Click on **"Add Project"** from your dashboard.

### Step 2: Fill in the Project Details

The editor is fully **WYSIWYG ✨**, meaning what you see is what you get. It's designed to be visual, intuitive, and easier to navigate. You can preview your project as you build it out, making the submission process a lot smoother (and a little more fun!)

### Step 3: Saving & Publishing Your Project ✍️

- **Project Status**: You will be sent to dashboard upon saving or publishing 🔗 [V2 Application](https://nsb.dev/devfolio_application_guide)
You can check your project status - If it is in **`In Draft`** or **`Submitted`**
- **Publish Project**: Once you're satisfied with all the details, click **`Publish Project`** to finalize your submission and make it publicly visible.
- **Edit Project**: Use the **`Edit project`** option from your Hackathon Dashboard to update your draft whenever needed - you can always come back later to review or make changes before the Hackathon Deadline hits.
