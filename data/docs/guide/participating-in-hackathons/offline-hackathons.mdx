title: Applying to Offline Hackathons
---
Offline hackathons are strictly team hackathons.

<Callout type="info" title="Note">
You can apply individually and may get accepted, but to make a project submission, joining or creating a team is mandatory.  
This is subject to the organizer’s discretion — some may allow individual participation.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Important!">
Once accepted, **each team member must RSVP** within the deadline so organizers can check you in.
