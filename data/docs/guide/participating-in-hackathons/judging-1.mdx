<Callout type="info" title="Heads up!">
This information is about judging in general. Hackathon organizers can set their own rules. Please refer to your organizer’s instructions for specific hackathon guidelines.
</Callout>


### 🛠 Can I Work on an Existing Project?

Unless otherwise specified, hackers are required to start their projects when the event begins so that no individual or team has a head-start. This ensures a fair playing field.

You'll be asked to share your source code (Git repo, Figma, etc.) during submission to confirm that work wasn’t done before the event.

You’re allowed to:
- Use open-source libraries
- Use starter kits/boilerplates
- Design a spec in advance

You’re not allowed to:
- Submit a modified version of a pre-existing project
- Port or continue older work unless pre-approved (but you’ll be ineligible for prizes)

<Callout type="info" title="Version control is required">
You must use version control throughout the hackathon. Submissions with a single commit or suspicious repo activity may be disqualified unless verified.
</Callout>

### 🚨 Process of Submission

1. Submit your project from your Hacker Dashboard.
   - This is also where you apply for Sponsor Prizes.
2. (Optional) Add a **demo video** (minimum 2 minutes).
3. For offline events, you may be required to do a **Live Demo**.
4. Submitting early is recommended! You can update your project until the submission deadline.

#### You’ll Likely See Two Submission Options

1. **Sponsor Prize Judging Only**
   - You won’t attend the **Main Live Judging**
   - Present at the relevant sponsor booth
   - Select sponsor prizes on the submission form

2. **Finalist & Sponsor Prize Judging**
   - You’ll present in **Main Live Judging** and to sponsors
   - Sponsor Judging also happens live at sponsor booths
   - Be sure to manage your time—these may happen in parallel!

<Callout type="info" title="Offline Note">
Not presenting live won’t affect your stake return.
</Callout>


### ❓ What if I Don’t Want to Submit My Hack?

We recommend submitting even unfinished hacks — celebrate your progress!

If you don’t want to present, you can still submit via your dashboard and receive your stake back.

<Callout type="warning" title="Finalists must demo live">
To qualify for the Finalist prize, live judging is mandatory.
</Callout>


### 🥇 Judging Criteria

Devfolio recommends evaluating based on:

1. **Technicality** – Complexity and approach to solving the problem  
2. **Originality** – Is the idea fresh and creative?  
3. **Practicality** – Is the project functional and usable?  
4. **Usability (UI/UX/DX)** – Is it smooth for users or developers?  
5. **Wow Factor** – Anything that leaves a lasting impression

<Callout type="info" title="Custom Criteria May Apply">
Organizers may use their own judging criteria. Always check hackathon-specific rules.

## 🎥 Tips for a Good Demo Video

- Submit a clear, concise walkthrough of your project
- Minimum length: **2 minutes**
- Maximum length: **4 minutes**
- Upload via the Hacker Dashboard
- Avoid music or copyrighted audio
- Use voice narration (AI-generated voices are OK if clear)

<Callout type="info" title="Don't rush!">
Speeding up your video might make it hard to understand. Edit wisely instead.
</Callout>

### Suggested Recording Approach

- Use Zoom or screen record tools to walk through your product
- Show project in action (not just slides)
- Avoid too much dead time (e.g., waiting on MetaMask)
- Prepare multiple tabs for faster switching
- Use slides sparingly — no more than 4 bullets per slide

## ❌ Common Mistakes (Avoid These!)

🚨 Don’t export videos below **720p**  
🚨 Don’t exceed the **4-minute limit**  
🚨 Don’t use sped-up videos  
🚨 Don’t overlay music with just text  
🚨 Don’t use a phone to record the submission  
🚨 Don’t use text-to-speech (AI-generated voice is OK if clear)
