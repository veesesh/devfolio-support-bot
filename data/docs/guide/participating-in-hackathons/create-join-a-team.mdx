## 🌐 Online Hackathons

<Callout type="info" title="Optional for individuals">
You can create or join a team anytime during the hackathon. For online-only hackathons, team formation is optional.
</Callout>

### 🛠 Creating and Joining a Team

1. Even if you plan to submit individually, you **must create a team before submission**.
2. You can create or join a team **anytime before you submit your project**.
3. When you submit as part of a team, **your combined team strength is evaluated** (skills, experience, past projects).  
   _Sometimes the whole is greater than the sum of its parts!_

## 🏢 Offline + Online with Application Review

<Callout type="info" title="Team formation is mandatory">
You can form teams either **while submitting your application** or **after individual acceptance**. Team formation is compulsory in these hackathon formats.
</Callout>

### 🛠 Creating a Team

<img src="/assets/ScreenRecording2025-06-17at8.50.32AM-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif" alt="Creating a team after acceptance" />

- We recommend applying as an **individual first**.
- Once accepted, go ahead and **create or join a team** before project submission.

### 🤝 Joining a Team

To join an existing team, you'll need:
- The **Invite Code** from your team admin
- A **fully filled application** (100% completion)
- To be **accepted individually** into the hackathon

<Callout type="warning" title="Heads up on edge case!">
If you're **still submitting** your application and try to join a team that’s already in “accepted” status, Devfolio will not allow it.  
Submit your application individually, and once accepted, you'll then be able to join the team.
</Callout>
