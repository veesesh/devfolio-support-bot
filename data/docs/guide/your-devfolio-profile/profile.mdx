## üîí Profile Visibility

Your profile is public by default. If you wish to make it private, you can do so in the [**Settings Tab**](settings.md)

> üí° **Heads-up**  
> The organizers will be going through your Devfolio profile as well. So, we recommend updating the profile with as much information regarding your experience and skills as possible.
