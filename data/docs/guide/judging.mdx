## Judging Mode

Devfolio offers three modes of Judging:

- **Online Judging**: For online hackathons.
- **Offline Judging**: For In Real Life (IRL) hackathons.
- **Sponsor Judging**: For sponsor tracks.

## Judging Criteria

Projects are evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **Technicality**: Is the project functional? Does it justify the hackathon duration?
- **Originality**: How innovative is the project? Does it bring a fresh perspective or solution?
- **Practicality**: Is the project useful and accessible (Mobile App, Web App, Desktop Application)?
- **Aesthetics**: How is the UI/UX of the project? Is it intuitive and user-friendly?
- **Wow Factor**: Does the project have a unique aspect that makes it stand out, even if it lacks in other criteria?

## Prerequisite for Judges

- A laptop (as the judging will be done on Devfolio).
- A Devfolio account. Follow these steps based on your current status:
  - If you do not have a Devfolio account:  
    Visit [devfolio.co/signup](https://devfolio.co/signup) and create an account with the same email ID on which you received the judging email. This will onboard you as a jury for the hackathon.
  - If you already have a Devfolio account:  
    Ensure you are logged in with the same email ID on which you received the judging email.
