description: Explore how Devfolio helps you showcase your work through projects 🏗️
---


Devfolio — as the name suggests, a portmanteau of **Developer** and **Portfolio** — is envisioned as a platform where developers can showcase their work to the world: whether it’s a hiring manager, a teammate, or a curious friend.

The best way to do this, apart from building out [your profile](your-dev-profile/), is to add projects.

Your **Projects** act as a living record of your skills and experiences — whether it’s a weekend side project, an open source contribution, or something you built at a hackathon.

<Callout type="info" title="Hackathon Submissions">
Projects submitted during Devfolio-hosted hackathons are automatically linked to your profile. You don’t need to add them manually.
</Callout>

That said, we encourage you to go beyond hackathons — add personal projects, experiments, learnings, or even work-in-progress ideas. It all adds up to a stronger portfolio 💪
