2. The project builders can make their case against the report by replying to DevfolioBot‚Äôs comment on their Project Page.

3. If Devfolio‚Äôs Content & Moderation team finds the report valid, the said project will be publicly flagged on the platform.

4. More builders can support the builders whose project, they believe, has been flagged as a mistake by replying or upvoting/downvoting other replies.
