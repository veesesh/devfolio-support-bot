## Adding a Project

Follow these steps to add a project to your Devfolio profile:

1. Head over to [**My Projects**](https://devfolio.co/my-projects).
2. Click on **"Add a Project"**
3. Choose whether you're adding the project for a hackathon or as a side project.

<Callout type="info" title="Active Hackathon Submission">
If you see an option to link to an active hackathon, it's because you're currently participating in one where submissions are open. If you donâ€™t see it, it means either the submission window is closed or you're not enrolled in any ongoing hackathon.
</Callout>
