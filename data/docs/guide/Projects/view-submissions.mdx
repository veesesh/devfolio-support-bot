You can view projects listed on Devfolio through a variety of different ways:

1. From the `Discover` page, you can scroll down to the Projects Spotlight and click on any Project.  
2. You can use our Global Search to search for a specific project.  
3. You can view projects that were submitted against a hackathon that was conducted on Devfolio.

<Callout type="info" title="Builder Profile Sync">
By default, projects created and submitted for a hackathon will automatically show up against the builder profile of the builder(s) that made it.
</Callout>

All submissions are collated in the `Projects` tab on the dedicated microsite of the hackathon. You can apply filters according to technology, prizes, and tracks to view the winners.
