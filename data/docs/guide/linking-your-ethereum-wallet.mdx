Your Devfolio profile can be linked to your Ethereum wallet to enable your participation in multiple initiatives on the platform, like quadratic voting, cheers, and claiming hackathon bounties.

The process to link your Ethereum Wallet to your Devfolio account can be initiated from multiple screens, namely:

* [Through the Account Settings Page](settings/)
* [While Cheering For a Project](cryptocheer/)
* [While Claiming Onchain Credentials](onchain-credentials/) like Soul-bound Tokens (SBTs)
* [While Participating in Quadratic Voting](quadratic-voting/) for a Hackathon
* [While Claiming Hackathon Bounties](/docs/guide/participating-in-hackathons/claims)

In any case, on the resultant screen from any flow, you can securely connect your Ethereum wallet to your Devfolio account by clicking on the 'Link Wallet' button.

* You will now be redirected to a special session on https://siwe.devfolio.co. This is Devfolio's implementation of the [Sign In With Ethereum](https://docs.login.xyz/), allowing you to leverage your Ethereum address and ENS profile to connect your Ethereum wallet to your Devfolio account.
* You will now be prompted to connect your wallet. While we do have dedicated flows to login with Metamask and Coinbase Wallet, Devfolio supports any Ethereum wallet like Rainbow, Unicorn, Family, etc.  
* Once done, as a second step, you will be prompted to verify your wallet address by signing a message. This message will appear in your wallet UI. You are encouraged to read the message and authorize once you are done.  

Once you are done, your Devfolio account will be linked to your Ethereum wallet. Depending on the action taken (fund transfer, signing a request, etc.) you may need to authorize your wallet multiple times by signing messages originating from Devfolio.


## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting: Issues While Connecting Your Wallet

* Please make sure that your wallet is only connected to one Devfolio account. If your wallet attempts to connect to more than one Devfolio account, then the signing process will fail.

* Please make sure you have adequate funds in the connected wallet (if failing while performing a fund transfer)
